This repo contains sample codes to conduction variable selection using Bayesian empirical likelihood. 

lib_v66.R is the library that contains the actual functions. 
Sample_code.R can be used as a quick example on how to run BEL variable selection. 
BEL_lasso_cv.R and BEL_scad_cv.R run the cross-validation-version of the BEL using lasso and scad prior respectively.
